    Fixed size replay buffer.
    The buffer is represented by using a deque from Pythonâ€™s built-in collections library.
    This is basically a list that we can set a maximum size.  If we try to add a new element whilst the list
    is already full, it will remove the first item in the list and add the new item to the end of the list.
    Hence new experiences  replace the oldest experiences.
    The experiences themselves are tuples of (state1, reward, action, state2, done) that we append to the replay deque
    and they are represented via the named tuple ExperienceTuple
